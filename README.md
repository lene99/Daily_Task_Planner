<p> Daily Task Planner is created using QtDesigner Tools and Python. </p>

<h2> Background </h2>
<p> A little bit of backstory to this personal project, I was actually lazy to look for applications / programs on the Internet to keep track of my daily tasks. Windows Sticky Notes has always been my go-to app for me to keep track of tasks. However, there were certain limitations to using Sticky Note for this purpose, and figured that I should create my own to-do task planner with the use of some simple Python code and the QtDesigner tool. </p>

<h2> Program Features </h2>
<p> In the current version of the tool (V1), the main functionalities are: </p>
